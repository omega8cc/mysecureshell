MySecureShell is a solution which has been made to bring **more features to sftp/scp protocol** given by `OpenSSH <http://www.openssh.com/>`_. By default, OpenSSH brings a lot of liberty to connected users which imply to trust in your users. The goal of MySecureShell is to **offer the power and security of OpenSSH, with enhanced features** (like `ACL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`_) to restrict connected users.

MySecureShell was created because of the lack of file transfer features in OpenSSH. OpenSSH was not designed as a file transfer solution, that's why we made MySecureShell.

**MySecureShell is not a patch for OpenSSH, it's a shell for users**. It has the advantage to:

* Avoid including security holes in OpenSSH
* No dependency on against an OpenSSH version
* No OpenSSH recompilation is required

So **MySecureShell remains easy to install, secure and easy to configure**.
